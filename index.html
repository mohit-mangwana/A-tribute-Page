 <b>Shaheed Bhagat Singh</b> was an Indian revolutionary socialist who played a prominent role in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. He was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga village, Punjab, British India (now in Pakistan) and was executed on March 23, 1931, at the age of 23 by the British colonial authorities.


Bhagat Singh was inspired by the works of Marxist thinkers and believed in the idea of socialism and the need for revolutionary change. He participated in numerous protests and actions against British colonial rule, including the famous Lahore Conspiracy Case, which resulted in his execution along with two other revolutionaries, Rajguru and Sukhdev.


Bhagat Singh is widely regarded as a hero and martyr in India, and his ideas and actions continue to inspire generations of Indians who fight for freedom and justice. He remains an important symbol of India's struggle for independence and the spirit of revolution against oppression.
